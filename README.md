MasterX System is an application featuring a custom-built compiler designed for Linux/macOS for ETL (Easy Toy Language), accompanied by a virtual playground for testing and exploration. This project is a personal endeavor in its early stages, aimed at enhancing my learning through practical application. 
For a demonstration of the WebAssembly version, which runs ATS as the shell and serves as a demo, please visit https://lostsidedead.biz/MasterX.

Note for Windows Users:

The application requires the latest Visual C++/Studio Runtimes and WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux), as it utilizes Bash as its shell the compiler was designed to work on Linux/macOS.
## Motivation
This project is a personal endeavor undertaken to enhance my skills and knowledge. As I believe the best way to learn is through practical application, this hobby project allows me to explore and experiment with compilers, 
and system-level programming. It represents my commitment to continuous learning and personal growth.

## Things I need TODO

- Better implementation of the terminal
- A TextEditor app in so you can edit files directly in the program
- Menus
- lots of other stuff (this is still in early stages of development)

The Dependencies are:

SDL2

SDL2_ttf

libpng

zlib

To install, you must compile the compiler from the source code by first compiling the library cxx_scan for the lexical analyzer then  ETL, and installing both in /usr/local on your WSL2 or Linux System.
