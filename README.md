MasterX System is a custom-built compiler designed for Linux, accompanied by a virtual playground for testing and exploration. This is my hobby project and its in its infant stage.

For a demonstration of the WebAssembly version, which runs ATS as the shell, and is just a demo visit MasterX WebAssembly Demo here: http://lostsidedead.biz/MasterX
For Windows users, the application requires the latest Visual C++/Studio Runtimes and WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) since the program utilizes Bash as its shell and the compiler is for Linux.

To install, you must compile the compiler from the source code by first compiling the library cxx_scan for the lexical analyzer then  ETL, and installing both in /usr/local on your WSL2 or Linux System.
