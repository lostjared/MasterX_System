## How to Play

Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the blocks:

- **Left/Right Arrow Keys**: Move the blocks horizontally.
- **Up Arrow Key**: Shift the order of the blocks.
- **Down Arrow Key**: Move the blocks down

The objective is to line up 3 blocks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. As the blocks come down, clear as many rows as possible before the screen fills up.

Challenge yourself to keep clearing blocks and avoid letting the screen overflow!

## How to Compile

To compile this, ensure you installed the ETL compiler by building it from the source code.
Currently, the platforms it supports are Linux, macOS, and WSL2 on Windows (Ubuntu 24.04).
Enter the directory containing this source code and type

```bash
make
```
